 # Summary

 Hey all, Kevin here. I am a junior student at  [Brockton High School](https://www.bpsma.org/schools/brockton-high-school) that enjoys making others happy and is a bit of a Philanthropist. I am currently seeking more oppotunities to get involved with the school, including joining clubs and doing extra-curricullar activities. The only languages that i know as of now are English and Latin, but i am intrestsed in learning other languages such as Spanish, Cape Verdean Creole, and Japanese.

 I enjoy several forms of media including politics, video games, movies, music, and other things such as Meme Culture.
 
 I love to listen to music as well, primarily 80s-90s New Jack Swing/R&B. My Favorite Music Artist is [Michael Jackson](https://www.michaeljackson.com/).

 # Family

Important, but spread across Massachusetts. Nothing real out of the ordinary but I usually spend time visiting my Dad's side during vacations.

My Grandmother however recently retired from an [organization](https://pathlightgroup.org/) that aids the physically and mentally disabled.

I am primarily Black/African-American but i have partial ancestry to indigenous tribes within Central America including Panama, Costa Rica, and Jamaica.
